# making a music patch

# I want to do a dark music for this assignment
1. I choose to use the note 0,1,3,6,11
2. add the metro for 200, and sel
3. I want the note plays random, so I add a random on the patch

# I feel like the music is not that good for me, so I search a tutorial to learn how to make this more interesting.

- I add a f for floating and let this %5 so the number will move and all %5 which is getting interesting
