# making a music patch

# I want to do a dark music for this assignment
1. I choose to use the note 0,1,3,6,11
2. add the metro for 200, and sel
3. I want the note plays random, so I add a random on the patch

# I feel like the music is not that good for me, so I search a tutorial to learn how to make this more interesting.

- I add a f for floating and let this %5 so the number will move and all %5 which is getting interesting

# The tutorial said that to making more fun is add a moses
-  so I add a moses, if the number is less than control value will go to left, if it's greater or equal will go to right.

## there is a question is that the sound is no more like dark music is like a helicopters, so at first I try to change a sound in logic
- right now I am using a synthesizers in kontakt, so what am I going to do is change to another sound for this. after trying so many times, I use the one that I have right now, which is in analog dream called Mona Liza,

# to make the shape
