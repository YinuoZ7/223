# Final Project

## Part 1 playing in pd use the sequencer that we have 
- I was playing between the different numbers these days
- I found that I really like the number I have right now
- I may don't confrim this melody right now, I want to try to still do some different melody this week.

## Part 2 try the different instrument in the daw

- I actually have some choices of these instrument
    - 1.  I want to use synth for this, so I was doing in the serum
    - 2.  I want to use piano 
    - 3.  I want to use bells just for fun 

- If I want to do the instrument in the serum, I will work on the sound in that this week.
